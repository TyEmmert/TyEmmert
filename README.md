Hello, I’m @TyEmmert.
I’m interested in Data Analytics and Data Science.

I have currently been creating my own projects via a climate data sheet from ORNL public database. My goal was to create data visuals that could be used to easily sumarize data for researchers. I often explore other math topics, because I am a teacher. I currently teach mathematics in high school, and creating code to explore topics of interest has consumed me.

My short term goals are to get a job in Data Analytics.
My long term goals are to establish a new career in data science. I want to learn more about machine learning, and then eventually deep learning.
