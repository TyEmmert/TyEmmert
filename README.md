Hello, I’m @TyEmmert.
I’m interested in Data Analytics and Data Science.

I currently teach mathematics in high school. My strive to create effective and efficient processes in teaching have led me to pursue a career in Data Analytics.

My short term goals are to get a job in Data Analytics.
My long term goals are to establish a new career in data science. I want to learn more about machine learning, and then eventually deep learning.
